            <p> So much of our history has been undocument, every now and then we try to dig a little deeper into the lives of those who once called our planet home. But the harder we try the more we learn new things that prove how little we know of our ancestors, thankfully not all of history is lost. With the help of writters from thousands of years we occasionally come across facinating stories and because i love stories and histories, i am excitted to talk about what might well be the greates rejection story ever </p>
